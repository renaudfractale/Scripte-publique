# Project Setup Instructions

There are two options to run this project:

- **Run locally (localhost) with GitLab**  
  → You need to choose the `localhost` folder.

- **Run on a web VM with GitLab** (recommended)  
  → You need to choose the `web` folder.  
  Ideally, use a C5 VM from [Paperspace](https://console.paperspace.com/).
